# Manual

Here we demonstrate some basic usages of Vlasiator output processing. For more complete description of the arguments, please refer to the [API](internal.md) documents or type `?foo` to display help message in the REPL.

## Common physical constants

A bunch of physical constants are predefined in Vlasiator.jl. To use them, you need to import explicitly, e.g. `using Vlasiator: RE` or prepend the module name like `Vlasiator.RE`.

| Physical constant | Value | Meaning |
|:---:|:--------------:|:-------------|
| qₑ | -1.60217662e-19 | electron charge, [C]             |
| mₑ | 9.10938356e-31  | electron mass, [kg]              |
| qᵢ | 1.60217662e-19  | proton mass, [C]                 |
| mᵢ | 1.673557546e-27 | proton mass, [kg]                |
| c  | 299792458.      | speed of light, [m/s]            |
| μ₀ | 4π*1e-7         | Vacuum permeability, [H/m]       |
| ϵ₀ | 1/(c^2*μ₀)      | Vacuum permittivity, [F/m]       |
| kB | 1.38064852e-23  | Boltzmann constant, [m²kg/(s²K)] |
| RE | 6.371e6         | Earth radius, [m]                |

## Loading VLSV data

- Read meta data

```
file = "bulk.0000004.vlsv"
meta = load(file)
```

This VLSV meta data contains information of file names, variable names, cell ID list, mesh sizes and species, which can then be passed into all kinds of methods that process the data.

- Read parameter

For convenience we support the do-block syntax that automatically closes the file stream.

```
t = load(file) do meta
   readparameter(meta, "time")
end
```

- Read variable meta data

```
readvariablemeta(meta, "proton/vg_rho")
```

A list of utility functions has been implemented for checking variable status. See [here](internal.md#Vlasiator.hasname-Tuple{Any, Any, Any}) for the full list.

- Read variable

```
data = meta["proton/vg_rho"]
# Or equivalently
data = readvariable(meta, "proton/vg_rho")
```

The variable reading is designed for cells, which takes cell ID(s) as inputs, although the same interface works for both DCCRG grid and FS grid variables. By default the returned DCCRG grid variable array is sorted by cell IDs. If in any case you want the original unsorted version as being stored in the file, use `readvariable(meta, var, false)`.

- Get variable at a given location

```
loc = [2.0, 0.0, 0.0]
id = getcell(meta, loc)
readvariable(meta, "proton/vg_rho", id)
```

- Get variable along a line between two points

```
using Vlasiator: RE # Earth radii
point1 = [12RE, 0, 0]
point2 = [15RE, 0, 0]
cellids, distances, coords = getcellinline(meta, point1, point2)
var_extract = readvariable(meta, "VA", cellids)
```

- Compare VLSV files

One may want to check if two vlsv files are identical. This is tricky because

1. the structure of VLSV format does not guarantee parallel writing order;
2. numerical error accumulates with floating point representation.

The key is that we should not check quantities that are related to MPI writing sequence: for some reasons, even file sizes may vary depending on the number of MPI processes!

```
issame(file1, file2)
```

There is an optional third argument to `issame` for setting the relative difference tolerance, with default being 1e-4.
In practice relative difference works better for "large" numbers, and absolute difference works better for "small" numbers.

## Computing derived quantities

Vlasiator is capable of computing moments and some derived quantities and save them directly into VLSV files.
More derived quantities computed from the saved quantities are also available in postprocessing, such as plasma β, velocity parallel/perpendicular to the magnetic field, pressure tensor with the third axis aligned with the magnetic field direction and so on.
To avoid confusion about variable names, the convention here is that

- if it is directly stored in the VLSV file, read the raw data;
- otherwise check the availability in the derived variable list. All predefined names start with a capital letter.

To obtain a derived quantity, use either keys of string or symbol,

```
beta = meta["Beta"]
VA = meta[:VA]
```

Here is a full list of available quantities[^1]:

which can also be found as keys of dictionary in [vlsvvariables.jl](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/tree/master/src/vlsv/vlsvvariables.jl).

[^1]: For species specific variables, you need to add the species name at the front, separated by a slash. For example, the proton bulk velocity is a string `proton/vg_v`.
[^2]: If a required variable exists in the VLSV file, we try to use it directly instead of calculating from other variables. The interpolated FS grid variables onto DCCRG grid are preferred over original FS grid variables.

!!! note
    In Vlasiator, the cells inside the inner boundary (which is usually a sphere/circle) are filled with zero density values. This is then used to identify the inner boundary for all other quantities. Therefore, if you are manipulating directly on data, make sure that the nonsense values inside the inner boundary are excluded. One way to do this can be found in [vlsvvariables.jl](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/blob/master/src/vlsv/vlsvvariables.jl).

!!! warning
    This part has not been carefully tested so it might not work or just generate wrong results. Contributions from users are warmly welcomed!

### Velocity space moments

We can also calculate the plasma moments from the saved VLSV velocity space distributions.

```
# VDF cell indexes and values, with sparsity
vcellids, vcellf = readvcells(meta, cellid; species="proton")

getdensity(meta, vcellids, vcellf)

getvelocity(meta, vcellids, vcellf)

getvelocity(meta, vcellids, vcellf)
```

To obtain the original ordering of velocity cells,

```
vcellids_original = Vlasiator.reorder(meta.meshes["proton"], vcellids)
```

Some useful quantities like non-Maxwellianity may be of interest. Currently we have implemented a monitor quantity named "Maxwellianity", which is defined as ``-ln \big[ 1/(2n) \int |f(v) - g(v)| dv \big]``, where n is the density, f(vᵢ) is the actual VDF value at velocity cell i, and g(vᵢ) is the analytical Maxwellian (or strictly speaking, normal) distribution with the same density, bulk velocity and scalar pressure as f.

```
getmaxwellianity(meta, vcellids, vcellf)
```

The value ranges from [0, +∞], with 0 meaning not Maxwellian-distributed at all, and +∞ a perfect Maxwellian distribution.

Sometimes it may be useful to recover the full 3D array of VDFs:

```
f = Vlasiator.reconstruct(meta.meshes["proton"], vcellids, vcellf)
```

However, usually in practice there would be only about 1% nonzero values. The moments and maxwellianity calculations above all have an alternative form of using reconstructed VDFs as inputs.

## Plotting

Vlasiator.jl does not include any plotting library as explicit dependency, but it offers plotting recipes/wrappers once the target plotting package is used.

Currently `PyPlot.jl` provides the most complete and fine-tuned plotting capabilities.
`Plots.jl`, which is a collection of multiple plotting libraries with uniform frontend, is catching up, but it lacks many detailed supports, an easy-to-use manual, and suffers from compatibilty issues.
`Makie.jl`, a native Julia plotting library, is also supported. Without generating an image from `PackageCompiler.jl`, it would take ~60s for the first plot. However, Makie has made nice progress in layouts, widgets, docs, demos and all the tiny things, which makes it a strong candidate for the suggested backend in the future.

More examples of customized plots can be found in the [repo](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/tree/master/src/examples).

### PyPlot Backend

To trigger Matplotlib plotting, `using PyPlot`.
All the functions with identical names as in Matplotlib accept all possible keyword arguments supported by their Matplotlib counterparts, e.g. font width, font size, colormap, etc.

!!! warning
    The method call to certain axes is not dispatched, e.g. `ax.plot`; as an alternative, one needs to pass `ax` as the third argument to the functions, e.g. `plot(meta, "rho", ax)`. See [Matplotlib's two interfaces](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/data-visualization/#matplotlib-has-two-different-interfaces) for details.

- Scalar colored contour from 2D simulation

```
pcolormesh(meta, "rho")
```

- Vector z component colored contour from 2D simulation in a manually set range

```
pcolormesh(meta, "rho", comp=:z, colorscale=Log, axisunit=EARTH, vmin=1e6, vmax=2e6)
```

- Vz colored contour from 2D simulation with prescribed colormap

```
pcolormesh(meta, "proton/vg_v", comp=:z, colorscale=Linear, cmap=matplotlib.cm.RdBu_r)
```

- Derived quantity colored contour from 2D simulation (as long as the input variable is in the predefined dictionary)

```
pcolormesh(meta, "b", comp=:z, colorscale=Linear, axisunit=SI)
```

- Streamline from 2D simulation

```
streamplot(meta, "rho_v", comp="xy")
```

- Quiver from 2D simulation

```
quiver(meta, "rho_v", comp="xy")
```

The `comp` option is used to specify the two vector components.

!!! note
    Currently there is limited support for derived variables. Submit an issue if something is not working!

You can choose to use linear/log/symlog color scale by setting keyword `colorscale` to `Linear`, `Log`, or `SymLog`, plot vector components by setting keyword `op` to `:x`, `:1`, or `:mag`, and set unit via `axisunit=EARTH` etc.

- Mesh denoted by cell centers

```
plotmesh(meta; projection="z", color="w")
```

- Cut slice colored contour from 3D simulation

```
pcolormesh(meta, "proton/vg_rho", normal=:y, origin=0.0)
```

- Velocity distribution function near a given spatial location `coordinates = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`

```
vdfslice(meta, coordinates)
```

- Extracted quantity line plot

```
rho_extract = vec(rho_extract)
loc = range(x1, x2, length=length(rho_extract))
plot(loc, rho_extract)
```

- Quick interactive variable selection

```
pui(meta)
```

Or pass filename directly like `pui(file)`. This is an experimental feature.

For a full list available optional arguments, please refer to the [doc for each method](internal.md#Public-APIs)

### Plots Backend

To trigger Plots.jl plotting, `using Plots`. By default [GR](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl) is loaded.
This backend supports all available attributes provided by [Plots.jl](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/). By default it uses [GR](https://gr-framework.org/), but a wide range of other options are also presented.

- Scaler colored contour from 2D simulation

```
heatmap(meta, var, aspect_ratio=:equal, c=:turbo)
```

- Scaler colored contour with lines from 2D simulation

```
contourf(meta, var)
```

- VDF projected slice in a normal direction

```
vdfslice(meta, location)
```

The keyword arguments are the same as in the PyPlot shown in the [API](internal.md#Vlasiator.vdfslice).

### Makie Backend

A standalone package [VlasiatorMakie.jl](https://github.com/henry2004y/VlasiatorMakie.jl) is designed for plotting with Makie. To trigger Makie plotting, `using VlasiatorMakie, GLMakie`.
You can either use intrinsic Makie plotting methods like

```
lines(meta, var)   # 1D
heatmap(meta, var) # 2D
```

or use full recipes customized by us

```
vlheatmap(meta, var)
```

For quickly inspecting the data, we have

- 2D slices of 3D AMR data

```
vlslice(meta, var; normal=:x)
```

- Orthognal slices of 3D AMR data

```
vlslices(meta, var)
```

- 2D slice of VDFs at a spatial cell

```
vdfslice(meta, location)
```

- Orthognal slices of VDFs at a spatial cell

```
vdfslices(meta, location)
```

- 3D scatter of VDFs at a spatial cell

```
vdfvolume(meta, location)
```

The interactive plots are available through the OpenGL backend of Makie `GLMakie`. For noninteractive high fidelity plots, we can also use the Cairo backend of Makie `CairoMakie`.

## Converting to VTK

We can convert VLSV files into VTK files! Since DCCRG is Cartesian based with uniform spacing, each level of refinement corresponds to a VTK image file, and the cell refinement relationships are defined by `vtkGhostType` as well as the `vthb` file.

To convert a VLSV file into VTK,

```
write_vtk(file)
```

This function accepts both file names and file meta.

To see the full list of options, please refer to the documentation in [API Reference](internal.md). Demo usage can be found [here](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/blob/master/examples/demo_convert2vti.jl).

!!! warning
    As of ParaView 5.9.1, there are [display issues](https://discourse.paraview.org/t/vthb-file-structure/7224) with `VTKOverlappingAMR`. However, we can read the generated image files directly. There is also an keyword argument for `write_vtk` called `maxamronly`: when it is set to `true`, then only the image file at the highest refinement level is generated.
    This part is experimental and subject to change in the future.

## Appending to VLSV

We are able to compute derived quantities from an original VLSV file and generate a new VLSV output with new quantities included.

```
vmag = readvariable(meta, "Vmag", meta.cellid)
pa = readvariable(meta, "Panisotropy", meta.cellid)
vars = Vector{Tuple{VecOrMat, String, VarInfo}}(undef, 0)
# require LaTeXStrings.jl
push!(vars, (vmag, "vmag", VarInfo("m/s", L"$\mathrm{m}/mathrm{s}$", L"$V$", "")))
push!(vars, (pa, "panisotropy", VarInfo("", "", "", "")))

write_vlsv("bulk.vlsv", "bulk_new.vlsv", vars)
```

!!! note
    Currently we only support writing new DCCRG variables. All quantities from the original file is maintained.

## Tracking log files

The runtime performance per iteration can be monitored through log files:

```
file = "logfile.txt"
timestamps, speed = readlog(file)
```

See a live example at [demo_log.jl](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/tree/master/examples/demo_log.jl).
